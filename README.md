# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe — Python (OOP + Pytest)

A clean and fully tested **console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game** written in **Python**, built with a strong focus on **object-oriented design**, **clean architecture**, and **unit testing**.

This project demonstrates solid **junior-level Python skills** and good engineering habits from the ground up.

---

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- Object-oriented design with clear separation of responsibilities
- Fully tested core game logic using **pytest**
- Complete win & draw detection (rows, columns, diagonals)
- Input validation and graceful error handling
- Clean, readable, and easily extensible codebase

---

## 🧠 What This Project Shows

- Understanding of **OOP principles**
- Ability to design **testable code**
- Clean project structure
- Attention to edge cases and correctness
- Practical use of unit tests (not just theory)
